# OpenNLP---Android-Example-
An android application which displays 'parts of speech' tags for questions entered.

Since there are very few examples of android applications using Apache's opennlp(https://opennlp.apache.org/) , this would also serve as an example of using opennlp to do Natural language processing in android.
