# Goal:
The idea is to be able to build a full fledged question answering system that can condense knowledge from uploaded pdf documents well enough to be able to answer a set of questions.  


# Whats done so far :
An android application which displays 'parts of speech' tags for questions entered using Apache's OpenNLP library(https://opennlp.apache.org/) . 


Demo :
